## Why Build Your Own Anycast Network?

Anycast routing enables you to serve users from the nearest location automatically, improving latency and providing built-in redundancy. Whether you're running a DNS service, a CDN, or want DDoS-resilient infrastructure, this guide walks you through every step.
