Before you can announce your prefixes through a hosting provider, you'll need to meet their requirements. This guide covers what providers typically ask for and how to prepare.

## What Providers Verify

Providers perform due diligence before allowing BGP announcements to protect their network and the broader internet.
Providers typically verify the following:
- Proof of ASN ownership
- Proof of IP space authorization
- Valid IRR objects
- Valid RPKI ROAs
- LOA (Letter of Authorization)

<Aside type="tip">
Prepare all documentation before requesting BGP service. Having everything ready speeds up the approval process significantly—sometimes from weeks to days.
</Aside>

## Letter of Authorization (LOA)

An LOA is a formal document stating you authorize the provider to announce your prefixes.

### What an LOA Contains

- Your organization/name
- Your ASN
- Prefixes being authorized
- Provider's ASN
- Date and signature

### LOA Template

```
LETTER OF AUTHORIZATION

Date: [Date]

To Whom It May Concern,

[Your Name/Organization] is the legitimate holder of AS[Your ASN] 
and the following IP prefixes:

- [Prefix 1]
- [Prefix 2]

We hereby authorize [Provider Name] (AS[Provider ASN]) to announce 
these prefixes on our behalf and accept them for routing.

This authorization is valid until revoked in writing.

Signature: _______________
Name: [Your Name]
Contact: [Your Email]
```

## BGP Session Configuration Details

You'll need to exchange technical details with your provider to establish the BGP session.

### Information You Provide

- Your ASN
- Prefixes to announce
- Preferred BGP password (MD5)
- Contact information

### Information Provider Gives You

- Provider ASN
- Provider BGP IP address
- Any specific configuration parameters

### Session Parameters

Some providers have specific requirements for BGP session parameters. These may include:
- **Multihop settings**
- **BGP timers**
- **Maximum prefix limits**

## Common Provider Policies

Providers have varying policies around BGP announcements. Understanding these helps avoid surprises.

### Prefix Length Requirements

Most providers require a minimum prefix length for announcements:
- IPv4: /24 minimum
- IPv6: /48 minimum

### RPKI Enforcement

Having valid RPKI ROAs for your prefixes is increasingly a requirement.

<Aside type="caution">
RPKI enforcement is increasingly common. Always create ROAs before attempting to announce prefixes. Some providers reject announcements immediately if RPKI validation fails.
</Aside>

### IRR Filtering

Providers often use IRR databases to filter announced prefixes. Ensure your route/route6 objects are correctly set up in the relevant IRR.

### Communities Support

Some providers support BGP communities for traffic engineering. Check with your provider for supported community values and usage.

## Provider Comparison

Different providers have different BGP offerings. Here's a brief overview of popular options for hobbyists.
