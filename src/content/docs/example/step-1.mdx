In this first step, we'll walk through acquiring the essential resources needed for anycast: your own IP address space and an Autonomous System Number (ASN).

## What You'll Need

Before deploying anycast, you need two key resources:

1. **IP Address Space** - A prefix (at least a /48 for IPv6) that you'll announce from multiple locations
2. **Autonomous System Number (ASN)** - A unique identifier for your network in BGP

<Aside>
For this example, we'll assume you're acquiring resources through an LIR (Local Internet Registry) or a provider that can sponsor your resources.

<Steps>
1. **Research LIRs**
2. **Submit your application**
3. **Receive your allocations**
4. **Document your resources**
</Steps>

This guide will not cover IPv4 setups, as it is similar to IPv6 deployments and out of scope for this guide.
</Aside>

## Verification

After receiving your resources, verify them in public databases:

For our example deployment, we'll use the following resources:

- **ASN**: AS65536
- **IPv6 Prefix**: 2001:db8:abcd::/48

```bash
# Check your ASN registration
whois AS65536

# Check your IPv6 prefix  
whois 2001:db8:abcd::/48
```

## Next Step

Once you have your IP space and ASN, you need to register them in the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) and set up RPKI for route origin validation.
