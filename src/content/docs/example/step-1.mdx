In this first step, we'll walk through acquiring the essential resources needed for anycast: your own IP address space and an Autonomous System Number (ASN).

## What You'll Need

Before deploying anycast, you need two key resources:

1. **IP Address Space** - A prefix (typically /24 for IPv4, /48 for IPv6) that you'll announce from multiple locations
2. **Autonomous System Number (ASN)** - A unique identifier for your network in BGP

<Aside>
For this example, we'll assume you're acquiring resources through an LIR (Local Internet Registry) or a provider that can sponsor your resources. Direct RIR membership is also an option but involves higher costs.

## Choosing Your Path

There are several ways to obtain IP space and an ASN:

| Method | Cost | Complexity | Best For |
|--------|------|------------|----------|
| LIR Sponsorship | Low | Low | Hobbyists, small projects |
| Provider Allocation | Varies | Low | Single-provider deployments |
| Direct RIR Membership | High | Medium | Organizations with ongoing needs |

## Example: Using an LIR

For our example deployment, we'll use a hypothetical LIR to obtain:

- **ASN**: AS65536
- **IPv6 Prefix**: 2001:db8:abcd::/48

<Steps>
1. **Research LIRs**
2. **Submit your application**
3. **Receive your allocations**
4. **Document your resources**
</Steps>

## Cost Considerations

Typical costs for LIR sponsorship:

- **Initial Setup**: $50-150 one-time
- **Annual Fees**: $50-200/year for ASN + IP maintenance
- **IPv4 Space**: May have additional costs due to scarcity

<Aside type="tip">
IPv6 space is generally much easier and cheaper to obtain than IPv4. Consider starting with IPv6-only if budget is a concern.
</Aside>

## Verification

After receiving your resources, verify them in public databases:

```bash
# Check your ASN registration
whois AS212345

# Check your IPv4 prefix
whois 203.0.113.0/24

# Check your IPv6 prefix  
whois 2001:db8:abcd::/48
```

## Next Step

Once you have your IP space and ASN, you need to register them in the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) and set up RPKI for route origin validation.
