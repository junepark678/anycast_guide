With your IP space and ASN acquired, the next critical step is registering your routes in the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) and setting up RPKI for cryptographic route origin validation.

## Why This Matters

Most transit providers and IXPs require:
- **IRR Registration**: For prefix filtering based on route objects
- **RPKI ROAs**: For Route Origin Authorization validation

Without these, your BGP announcements will likely be rejected by upstream providers.

<Aside type="caution">
Skipping this step is the most common reason for failed BGP sessions. Complete IRR and RPKI setup before attempting to announce your prefixes.
</Aside>

## IRR Registration

The IRR is a distributed database of routing policies. You'll need to create objects for your ASN and prefixes.

### Creating IRR Objects

For our example resources (AS65536, 2001:db8:abcd::/48):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="aut-num Object">
```
aut-num:        AS65536
as-name:        EXAMPLE-ANYCAST
descr:          Example Anycast Network
org:            ORG-EXAMPLE-RIPE
admin-c:        ADMIN-RIPE
tech-c:         TECH-RIPE
status:         ASSIGNED
mnt-by:         EXAMPLE-MNT
created:        2024-01-15T12:00:00Z
last-modified:  2024-01-15T12:00:00Z
source:         RIPE
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="route6 Object (IPv6)">
```
route6:         2001:db8:abcd::/48
descr:          Example Anycast IPv6
origin:         AS65536
mnt-by:         EXAMPLE-MNT
created:        2024-01-15T12:00:00Z
last-modified:  2024-01-15T12:00:00Z
source:         RIPE
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Submitting IRR Objects

<Steps>
1. **Access your RIR/LIR portal**
   
   Log into your RIR's database portal (e.g., RIPE Database, ARIN IRR)

2. **Create route objects**
   
   Submit route and route6 objects linking your prefixes to your ASN

3. **Verify creation**
   ```bash
   # Check route object
   whois -h whois.radb.net 2001:db8:abcd::/48
   ```

4. **Wait for propagation**
   
   IRR updates typically propagate within minutes to hours
</Steps>

## RPKI Setup

RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) allows you to create ROAs (Route Origin Authorizations) that cryptographically verify your right to announce specific prefixes from your ASN. Generally, you cannot use the RPKI services of the RIR unless you are using only direct allocations/assignments for resources, which is not the case for many users. Therefore, in this guide, we will walk through using Krill, a common open-source RPKI management tool.

### Installing Krill

Follow the official Krill installation guide: [Krill Installation](https://krill.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/stable/install-and-run.html)

### Configuring Krill

Once you installed Krill, you need to receive the resources from your upstream provider or LIR. This part varies depending on the place you received your resources from. If you received it from a LIR, you should contact their support. They will usually ask you to provide your 

## Verification Checklist

Before proceeding, confirm:

- [ ] Route objects exist in IRR for all prefixes
- [ ] ROAs are published for all prefixes
- [ ] RPKI validation shows "valid" status
- [ ] Objects reference the correct origin ASN

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| ROA not found | Propagation delay | Wait 15-30 minutes, then recheck |
| Invalid state | Wrong origin ASN | Verify ASN in ROA matches your ASN |
| Route filtered | Missing IRR object | Create route/route6 objects |

## Next Step

With IRR and RPKI configured, you're ready to set up BGP on your servers.
