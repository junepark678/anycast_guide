Anycast is a network addressing and routing methodology where a single IP address is announced from multiple locations simultaneously. When a user connects to an anycast address, they're automatically routed to the nearest (or best) instance based on BGP routing metrics.

When you buy a product from Amazon.com, you don't care which warehouse it ships from; as long as it arrives quickly, you get the same product at your doorstep. Anycast works similarly for internet services: users are directed to the closest server hosting the service, improving performance and reliability. This works particularly well for stateless services like DNS, CDN edge nodes, and DDoS mitigation.

## How Anycast Works

At its core, anycast leverages the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to announce the same IP prefix from multiple points of presence (PoPs) around the world. The internet's routing infrastructure naturally directs traffic to the topologically closest announcement.

At each PoP, a BGP announcement is made for the anycast IP prefix. Routers across the internet receive these announcements and build their routing tables accordingly. Generally, routers will prefer the path with the shortest Autonomous System (AS) path length, effectively routing users to the nearest (in network topology) server.

<Aside type="note">
TL;DR: Anycast is just making multiple BGP announcements for the same prefix, resulting in natural load balancing and redundancy.

## Anycast vs Unicast

Understanding the difference between anycast and unicast is fundamental to grasping why anycast is powerful for certain applications.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Unicast">
    Unicast is the traditional method of network communication where a single unique IP address corresponds to a single device. When you connect to a unicast address, your traffic is routed to that specific device, regardless of its location.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Anycast">
    Anycast, on the other hand, allows multiple devices to share the same IP address.

### When Unicast Makes Sense

Unicast remains the right choice for stateful, long-lived connections where session persistence matters.

{/* TODO: Examples of unicast-appropriate applications */}

### When Anycast Excels

Anycast shines for stateless protocols and services where automatic failover and geographic distribution are priorities.

## Common Use Cases

Anycast powers some of the most critical infrastructure on the internet. Here's where it's commonly deployed:

### DNS Services

DNS is the most common anycast use case. Major DNS providers like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) and Google (8.8.8.8) use anycast to serve billions of queries daily from hundreds of locations.

### Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

CDNs use anycast to route users to the nearest edge server, reducing latency and improving download speeds.

{/* TODO: Explain CDN anycast architecture and TCP anycast considerations */}

### DDoS Mitigation

Anycast provides natural DDoS resilience by distributing attack traffic across multiple locations, preventing any single point from being overwhelmed.

## Benefits of DIY Anycast

Building your own anycast network is more accessible than ever. Here's why hobbyists and small organizations are taking control of their network infrastructure:

### Cost Efficiency

With sponsorship programs and affordable colocation, running a small anycast network can cost less than premium managed services.

### Learning Opportunity

There's no better way to understand internet routing than building and operating your own anycast network.

{/* TODO: Skills gained and career benefits */}

### Full Control

Own your IP space, control your routing policy, and never worry about vendor lock-in.

{/* TODO: Expand on independence and flexibility benefits */}

## Next Steps

Now that you understand what anycast is and why it's valuable, let's look at what you'll need to build your own anycast network.
