Before diving into anycast configuration, you'll need to gather resources and develop foundational knowledge. This page outlines everything required to build and operate your own anycast network.

{/* TODO: Brief encouraging paragraph about the journey ahead */}

## Technical Requirements

Building an anycast network requires several key resources. Here's what you'll need to acquire:

### ASN (Autonomous System Number)

An ASN is your unique identifier in the global BGP routing table. You'll need one to peer with upstream providers and announce your IP prefixes.

{/* TODO: Explain ASN types (16-bit vs 32-bit), how to obtain from RIRs, and sponsorship options */}

<Aside type="tip">
  Many LIRs offer ASN sponsorship programs that can significantly reduce costs for hobbyists. Check the [resources section](/resources/getting-asn/) for recommended sponsors.
</Aside>

### IP Address Space

You'll need at least a /48 IPv6 prefix and ideally a /24 IPv4 prefix (the minimum typically accepted for global BGP announcements).

{/* TODO: Explain minimum prefix sizes, provider independent vs provider assigned, and acquisition options */}

### Servers in Multiple Locations

Anycast requires presence in multiple geographic locations. You'll need servers or VPS instances capable of running BGP software.

{/* TODO: Discuss colocation options, VPS providers that allow BGP, and minimum recommended locations */}

<Aside type="caution">
  Not all VPS providers allow BGP sessions. Verify BGP support before committing to a provider. We maintain a list in our [recommended providers](/resources/providers/) section.
</Aside>

### Upstream Connectivity

Each location needs BGP connectivity to the internet, either through direct upstream providers or internet exchange points (IXPs).

{/* TODO: Explain transit vs peering, IXP membership, and connectivity options for hobbyists */}

## Understanding BGP Basics

A working knowledge of BGP is essential for operating an anycast network. Here are the concepts you should understand:

### Core BGP Concepts

Before configuring your first router, familiarize yourself with these fundamentals:

{/* TODO: List and briefly explain: AS path, prefix announcements, BGP communities, route filtering, peering vs transit */}

### Route Filtering and Security

Responsible anycast operation requires proper route filtering to prevent leaks and hijacks.

{/* TODO: Explain IRR, RPKI, prefix filters, and why they matter */}

<Aside type="danger">
  Misconfigured BGP can disrupt internet routing beyond your network. Always implement proper filters and test configurations carefully before announcing prefixes globally.
</Aside>

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

You'll need to monitor your announcements and troubleshoot routing issues:

{/* TODO: Introduce looking glasses, RIPE RIS, BGP tools, and monitoring approaches */}

## Cost Considerations

Running a DIY anycast network involves several cost categories. Here's a realistic breakdown:

### Initial Setup Costs

One-time expenses to get your network operational:

{/* TODO: Breakdown of ASN fees, IP allocation fees, initial hardware/VPS costs */}

### Ongoing Monthly Costs

Recurring expenses to maintain your network:

{/* TODO: Breakdown of hosting, transit/peering fees, RIR membership if applicable */}

### Budget Options

Anycast doesn't have to break the bank. Here are ways to minimize costs:

{/* TODO: Discuss sponsorship programs, free IXP ports, budget VPS providers with BGP support */}

<Aside type="note">
  Many hobbyists run functional anycast networks for under $100/month across multiple locations. Cost optimization strategies are covered in our [budget guide](/guides/budget-anycast/).
</Aside>

## Time Investment

Be realistic about the time required to build and operate an anycast network:

### Initial Learning Curve

If you're new to BGP, expect to spend time learning before configuring:

{/* TODO: Estimated hours for learning BGP basics, recommended resources and tutorials */}

### Setup Time

Once you have resources and knowledge, deployment takes time:

{/* TODO: Estimated timeline from ASN acquisition to first announcement */}

### Ongoing Maintenance

Running an anycast network is an ongoing commitment:

{/* TODO: Discuss monitoring, updates, incident response, and realistic time expectations */}

## Knowledge Checkpoints

Before proceeding, ensure you can answer these questions:

{/* TODO: List of self-assessment questions covering BGP basics, resource requirements, and realistic expectations */}

## Next Steps

With an understanding of what's required, you're ready to learn about anycast architecture patterns and plan your network design.
